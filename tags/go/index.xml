      <description>What is SOLID The SOLID is an acronym created in 2004 based on principles that Uncle Bob introduced in the 2000s to identify the best practices of software design.&#xA;ðŸ’¡ Disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m not giving a full description of the SOLID pattern because a lot of folks have done that. Digital Ocean has done that and the Uncle Bob himself has done that Although the SOLID principles may apply to any object-oriented design, they usually bring with them the Clean Code and Clean Architecture philosophies.</description>

      <description>The future of development brings many innovations with artificial intelligence, autonomous agents, and dedicated edge hardware. Golang has a short learning curve, consistency across domains, and fast build times â€” three of the main drivers of productivity. (See more in the video below)</description>

      <description>One famous debate that emerges in every design discussion is about interfaces. As always, each programmer has a different conception about it and itâ€™s something almost inevitable to spend hours arguing about. Even when the discussion isnâ€™t about whether or not we should use it, itâ€™s about how to use it. As a programmer, I have my own opinion as well. I expect to give you an overview about the importance of interfaces when you should or not use it, and what you can apply it to.</description>

      <description>Why you should read this Ok, I know we have thousands of different (and better) articles explaining how to start coding in Golang (tour of Go, Effective Go and etc). Considering it, Iâ€™m going to focus on real examples (and some code) to make your Go journey a little bit easier, i.e., how to organize your go code, how to connect to a database, how to log things and what framework options (if any) to consider.</description>
