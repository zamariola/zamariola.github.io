      <description>1) Name your classes/interfaces with specific names instead of “Default” or “YourCustumer” prefix. First of all, we have to keep this important thing in mind: we are coding general and abstract business and technical rules. &amp;ldquo;Coincidentally&amp;rdquo;, these rules are being used by our customer.
